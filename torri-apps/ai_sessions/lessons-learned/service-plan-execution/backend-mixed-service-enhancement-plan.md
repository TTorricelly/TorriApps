# Backend Enhancement Plan: Mixed Service Support

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the backend to support mixed parallelizable/sequential service scenarios and make the system more flexible for future use cases.

## ðŸš¨ **Current Limitations Analysis**

### **1. Strict Parallelization Logic**
```python
# Current problematic code (Line 388-390)
def _can_execute_in_parallel(self, service_requirements: List[ServiceRequirement]) -> bool:
    """Check if all services can be executed in parallel."""
    return all(req.parallelable for req in service_requirements)  # TOO STRICT!
```

**Problem**: Requires ALL services to be parallelizable, rejecting mixed scenarios entirely.

### **2. Binary Execution Types**
```python
# Current ResourceCombination (Line 51-56)
@dataclass
class ResourceCombination:
    services: List[Service]
    professionals: List[User]
    stations: Dict[str, List[Station]]
    execution_type: str  # Only "parallel" or "sequential"
```

**Problem**: No support for mixed execution strategies.

### **3. Missing Mixed Itinerary Logic**
```python
# Current itinerary building (Lines 117-122)
if combination.execution_type == "parallel":
    parallel_slots = self._build_parallel_itinerary(combination, request.date)
elif combination.execution_type == "sequential":
    sequential_slots = self._build_sequential_itinerary(combination, request.date)
# No handling for "mixed" execution type
```

**Problem**: No logic to handle services that need both parallel and sequential execution.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Enhancement Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Execution Strategy System**

#### **1.1 New Execution Strategy Enum**
```python
from enum import Enum

class ExecutionStrategy(Enum):
    SEQUENTIAL = "sequential"           # All services sequential
    PARALLEL = "parallel"               # All services parallel  
    MIXED_PARALLEL_FIRST = "mixed_parallel_first"   # Parallel services first, then sequential
    MIXED_SEQUENTIAL_FIRST = "mixed_sequential_first" # Sequential services first, then parallel
    MIXED_INTERLEAVED = "mixed_interleaved"         # Optimal interleaving of services
    HYBRID = "hybrid"                   # Multiple execution combinations
```

#### **1.2 Enhanced ResourceCombination**
```python
@dataclass
class ExecutionGroup:
    """Represents a group of services with the same execution type"""
    services: List[Service]
    professionals: List[User]
    execution_type: ExecutionStrategy
    estimated_duration: int
    dependencies: List[str] = None  # Service IDs this group depends on

@dataclass  
class ResourceCombination:
    """Enhanced resource combination supporting mixed execution"""
    execution_groups: List[ExecutionGroup]  # Multiple execution groups
    stations: Dict[str, List[Station]]
    overall_strategy: ExecutionStrategy
    total_estimated_duration: int
    preference_score: float = 0.0  # For ranking combinations
```

#### **1.3 Smart Execution Strategy Detection**
```python
def _determine_execution_strategy(
    self, 
    service_requirements: List[ServiceRequirement],
    professionals_requested: int
) -> ExecutionStrategy:
    """
    Intelligently determine the best execution strategy for mixed services.
    
    Returns:
        ExecutionStrategy: The optimal strategy for the given services
    """
    parallel_services = [req for req in service_requirements if req.parallelable]
    sequential_services = [req for req in service_requirements if not req.parallelable]
    
    # Pure scenarios
    if len(sequential_services) == 0:
        return ExecutionStrategy.PARALLEL
    if len(parallel_services) == 0:
        return ExecutionStrategy.SEQUENTIAL
    
    # Mixed scenarios - choose based on optimization criteria
    if professionals_requested == 1:
        return ExecutionStrategy.SEQUENTIAL  # Single professional must do all sequentially
    
    # Multiple professionals available
    if len(parallel_services) >= len(sequential_services):
        return ExecutionStrategy.MIXED_PARALLEL_FIRST
    else:
        return ExecutionStrategy.MIXED_SEQUENTIAL_FIRST
```

### **Phase 2: Mixed Execution Logic Implementation**

#### **2.1 Enhanced Resource Combination Generation**
```python
def _generate_enhanced_resource_combinations(
    self,
    service_requirements: List[ServiceRequirement], 
    eligible_professionals: List[User],
    professionals_requested: int

    """
    Generate resource combinations supporting mixed execution strategies.
    """
    combinations = []
    
    # Determine optimal execution strategy

                    )
                    
                    # Determine group order based on strategy
                    if strategy == ExecutionStrategy.MIXED_PARALLEL_FIRST:

                    if stations:  # Only add if stations are available
                        combination = ResourceCombination(
                            execution_groups=execution_groups,

                        combinations.append(combination)
    
    return combinations
```

#### **2.2 Mixed Itinerary Building**
```python
def _build_mixed_itinerary(
    self, 
    combination: ResourceCombination, 
    target_date: date
) -> List[WizardTimeSlot]:
    """Build itinerary for mixed execution strategies."""
    
    all_slots = []
    
    for execution_group in combination.execution_groups:

                execution_group, target_date, combination.stations
            )
        else:

    )
    
    return optimized_slots

    group_slots: List[WizardTimeSlot],
    execution_groups: List[ExecutionGroup], 
    target_date: date
) -> List[WizardTimeSlot]:
    """Optimize timing for mixed execution groups."""
    
    # Find optimal start times considering:
    # 1. Professional availability across groups
    # 2. Station availability across groups  
    # 3. Optimal transitions between groups
    # 4. Client convenience (minimize total time)
    
    optimized_slots = []
    
    # Implementation would handle complex timing optimization
    # This is where the real scheduling intelligence happens
    
    return optimized_slots
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Validation & Optimization**

#### **3.1 Mixed Combination Validation**
```python
def _validate_mixed_combination(
    self,
    parallel_services: List[ServiceRequirement],
    sequential_services: List[ServiceRequirement],
    parallel_professionals: List[User],
    sequential_professionals: List[User]
) -> bool:
    """Validate that a mixed professional combination can handle all services."""
    
    # Check parallel services coverage
    parallel_service_ids = {req.service.id for req in parallel_services}
    parallel_coverage = set()
    for prof in parallel_professionals:
        prof_services = {service.id for service in prof.services_offered}
        parallel_coverage.update(prof_services.intersection(parallel_service_ids))
    
    if not parallel_service_ids.issubset(parallel_coverage):
        return False
    
    # Check sequential services coverage  
    sequential_service_ids = {req.service.id for req in sequential_services}
    sequential_coverage = set()
    for prof in sequential_professionals:
        prof_services = {service.id for service in prof.services_offered}
        sequential_coverage.update(prof_services.intersection(sequential_service_ids))
    
    if not sequential_service_ids.issubset(sequential_coverage):
        return False
    
    # Additional validations:
    # - Station requirements compatibility
    # - Professional working hours overlap
    # - Service duration constraints
    
    return True

def _calculate_preference_score(self, execution_groups: List[ExecutionGroup]) -> float:
    """Calculate preference score for ranking combinations."""
    score = 0.0
    
    # Factors affecting preference:
    # - Total duration (shorter is better)
    # - Professional utilization (balanced is better)
    # - Station conflicts (fewer is better)
    # - Service dependencies satisfaction
    
    # Shorter total duration gets higher score
    total_duration = sum(group.estimated_duration for group in execution_groups)
    duration_score = max(0, 240 - total_duration) / 240.0  # Normalize to 0-1
    
    # Balanced professional usage gets higher score
    balance_score = self._calculate_professional_balance_score(execution_groups)
    
    # Fewer station conflicts get higher score
    station_score = self._calculate_station_efficiency_score(execution_groups)
    
    # Weighted combination
    score = (duration_score * 0.4 + balance_score * 0.3 + station_score * 0.3)
    
    return score
```

### **Phase 4: Backward Compatibility & Migration**

#### **4.1 Gradual Migration Strategy**
```python
# Update main itinerary building logic
def _build_itineraries_enhanced(self, combination: ResourceCombination, target_date: date):
    """Enhanced itinerary building with backward compatibility."""
    
    # Check if this is a legacy ResourceCombination (has execution_type string)
    if hasattr(combination, 'execution_type') and isinstance(combination.execution_type, str):
        # Legacy path - maintain existing behavior
        if combination.execution_type == "parallel":
            return self._build_parallel_itinerary(combination, target_date)
        elif combination.execution_type == "sequential":
            return self._build_sequential_itinerary(combination, target_date)
    
    # New enhanced path
    if combination.overall_strategy in [ExecutionStrategy.MIXED_PARALLEL_FIRST, 
                                       ExecutionStrategy.MIXED_SEQUENTIAL_FIRST,
                                       ExecutionStrategy.MIXED_INTERLEAVED]:
        return self._build_mixed_itinerary(combination, target_date)
    elif combination.overall_strategy == ExecutionStrategy.PARALLEL:
        return self._build_parallel_itinerary_from_groups(combination, target_date)
    else:
        return self._build_sequential_itinerary_from_groups(combination, target_date)
```

#### **4.2 Feature Flag Support**
```python
# Add configuration flag for mixed service support
class MultiServiceConfig:
    ENABLE_MIXED_EXECUTION = True  # Feature flag
    MAX_EXECUTION_GROUPS = 3       # Limit complexity
    MIXED_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = "balanced"  # "fast" | "balanced" | "optimal"

def _should_use_enhanced_logic(self) -> bool:
    """Check if enhanced mixed service logic should be used."""
    return MultiServiceConfig.ENABLE_MIXED_EXECUTION
```
