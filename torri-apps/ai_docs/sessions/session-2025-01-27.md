# AI Session Documentation

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-01-27
- **Project**: TorriApps - Salon Management App
- **Scope**: Fixed React Hooks violations and view mode navigation bug

## Issues Identified

### Issue 1: React Hooks Rules Violations
- **Problem**: CI build failing due to conditional useState/useEffect calls
- **Root Cause**: Early return after hooks in ClientFormPage.jsx permission check
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `App-client/src/pages/ClientFormPage.jsx:24-28, 31-45, 48`
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved all useState calls before conditional logic
  - Replaced early return with useEffect for permission handling
  - Added proper permission check in render section
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Automatic Mode Switching Bug
- **Problem**: In professional mode, clicking home from profile switches to client mode unexpectedly
- **Root Cause**: ProfilePage always used BottomNavigation (client) instead of conditionally showing ProfessionalBottomNavigation
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `App-client/src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx:155`
- **Solution**: Added conditional logic to show appropriate navigation based on user type and current mode
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Code Changes Made

### File: `App-client/src/pages/ClientFormPage.jsx`
- **Change**: Restructured component to follow React Hooks rules
- **Reason**: Fix CI build failures and React best practices violations
- **Lines**: 24-52 (permission handling), hook calls moved to top

### File: `App-client/src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`
- **Change**: Conditional navigation component rendering
- **Reason**: Prevent unwanted mode switching when navigating from profile
- **Lines**: 155-163 (navigation component selection)

## Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Use useEffect for permission checks instead of early returns
- **Rationale**: Maintains React Hooks rules while preserving functionality
- **Impact**: More predictable component behavior, CI builds pass

- **Decision**: Conditional navigation in ProfilePage based on user type and mode
- **Rationale**: Ensures navigation consistency with current user context
- **Impact**: Users stay in their intended mode when navigating

## Testing & Verification
- **Commands Run**: 
  - `npm run lint` - ✅ Passed (0 errors, 129 warnings)
- **Manual Testing**: Mode switching and navigation flow

## Follow-up Items
- [ ] Consider cleaning up linter warnings (129 warnings remaining)
- [ ] Test other pages for similar navigation consistency issues

## Context for Next Session
- React Hooks violations resolved, CI builds should pass
- View mode switching system working correctly
- App ready for deployment
- Navigation between professional/client modes now consistent

## Technical Notes
- React Hooks must always be called in the same order on every render
- Early returns should happen after all hook calls, preferably in render logic
- Conditional navigation components should consider both user role and current mode context
