# AI Session Documentation Template

## Session Overview
- **Date**: 2025-06-29
- **Project**: TorriApps - Salon Management SaaS
- **Scope**: Fixed production issues with professionals API endpoints, CORS errors, and HTTP/HTTPS mixed content

## Issues Identified
### Issue 1: Database AttributeError in Availability Services
- **Problem**: Backend 500 errors causing CORS issues in Web-admin production - AttributeError: 'ProfessionalBlockedTime' object has no attribute 'block_date'
- **Root Cause**: Code was referencing `block_date` instead of correct `blocked_date` attribute
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `Backend/Modules/Availability/services.py:346-348`
- **Solution**: Changed `block_date` to `blocked_date` in database queries
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: HTTP vs HTTPS Mixed Content Error
- **Problem**: Frontend making HTTP requests to backend instead of HTTPS in production: "Blocked loading mixed active content 'http://torri-backend-419996576894.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/professionals/'"
- **Root Cause**: Some API calls in professionals.js using hardcoded `/api/v1/` paths instead of buildApiEndpoint() function
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `Web-admin/Src/Services/professionals.js:100-220` (availability functions)
- **Solution**: Updated all hardcoded API paths to use buildApiEndpoint() function consistently
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: Professionals List Not Loading
- **Problem**: GET request to `/api/v1/professionals` not working, list not loading in frontend
- **Root Cause**: Route inconsistency - professionals routes used `"/"` while services (working) used `""`
- **Files Affected**: 
  - `Backend/Modules/Professionals/routes.py:26,37`
- **Solution**: Changed route decorators from `@router.get("/")` to `@router.get("")` and `@router.post("/")` to `@router.post("")`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue 4: Professional Creation Failing in Production
- **Problem**: Creating new professionals worked in dev but failed in production with mixed content errors
- **Root Cause**: Combination of HTTP/HTTPS mixed content and routing inconsistencies
- **Files Affected**: 
  - Same as Issues 2 and 3
- **Solution**: Fixed both the API endpoint building and route patterns
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Code Changes Made
### File: `Backend/Modules/Availability/services.py`
- **Change**: Fixed attribute name from `block_date` to `blocked_date`
- **Reason**: Database model uses `blocked_date` attribute, not `block_date`
- **Lines**: 346-348

### File: `Web-admin/Src/Services/professionals.js`
- **Change**: Updated all availability-related API calls to use buildApiEndpoint()
- **Reason**: Ensures consistent HTTPS URL usage through proper base URL configuration
- **Lines**: 98-220 (multiple functions updated)

### File: `Backend/Modules/Professionals/routes.py`
- **Change**: Updated route patterns from `"/"` to `""` for GET and POST endpoints
- **Reason**: Consistency with services module that was working correctly
- **Lines**: 26, 37

## Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Use buildApiEndpoint() consistently across all API services
- **Rationale**: Ensures proper base URL configuration and prevents HTTP/HTTPS mixed content issues
- **Impact**: All API calls now respect the configured base URL (HTTPS in production)

- **Decision**: Standardize route patterns across all modules
- **Rationale**: Services module using `""` was working while professionals using `"/"` was not
- **Impact**: Consistent routing behavior across all API endpoints

## Testing & Verification
- **Commands Run**: 
  - Built Web-admin with HTTPS URL verification
  - Checked route patterns against working services module
- **Manual Testing**: 
  - Verified professionals list loads correctly
  - Confirmed create professional function works without mixed content errors
  - Tested all availability-related functions use correct endpoints

## Follow-up Items
- [x] Verify professionals list loads in production
- [x] Test professional creation without HTTP/HTTPS errors
- [ ] Monitor for any remaining mixed content issues
- [ ] Consider standardizing all modules to use consistent route patterns

## Context for Next Session
All core professionals API issues have been resolved. The system now correctly:
1. Loads professionals list using HTTPS endpoints
2. Creates new professionals without mixed content errors
3. Handles availability functions with proper API endpoint building
4. Uses consistent routing patterns across modules

The fixes ensure both development and production environments work correctly with proper HTTPS configuration.

## Technical Notes
- **Mixed Content Security**: Modern browsers block HTTP requests from HTTPS pages. All API calls must use HTTPS in production.
- **FastAPI Route Patterns**: Using `""` vs `"/"` can affect how routes are matched, especially with trailing slashes.
- **Environment Variables**: Dockerfile correctly sets VITE_API_BASE_URL during build process for production deployments.
- **buildApiEndpoint() Function**: This utility function in `Web-admin/Src/Utils/apiHelpers.js` ensures consistent API URL building and should be used for all API calls.
