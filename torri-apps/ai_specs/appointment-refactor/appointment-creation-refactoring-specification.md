# TorriApps Appointment Creation Refactoring Specification

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: July 14, 2025
- **Author**: AI Code Assistant
- **Status**: Draft - Awaiting Review

## Executive Summary

The TorriApps system currently has **7 distinct appointment creation patterns** across multiple frontends and backends, resulting in significant code duplication and architectural inconsistencies. This specification outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan to unify appointment creation using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Factory Pattern, and modern best practices.

**Key Goals:**
- Eliminate 90% of duplicate appointment creation logic
- Unify business rules across all creation methods
- Implement consistent pricing/duration calculations
- Create maintainable, testable architecture
- Support future unified multi-appointment vision

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Backend Appointment Creation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Legacy Single Appointment Creation
- **Route**: `POST /appointments`
- **File**: `Backend/Modules/Appointments/routes.py:122-145`
- **Service**: `appointment_crud.py:create_appointment()`
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ **DEPRECATED** - Will be replaced with unified multi-appointment system
- **Issues**: 
  - Creates unnecessary AppointmentGroup for single appointments
  - Limited validation
  - Inconsistent with modern patterns

#### Pattern 2: Multi-Service Wizard Booking
- **Route**: `POST /appointments/wizard/book`
- **File**: `Backend/Modules/Appointments/routes.py:736-755`
- **Service**: `wizard_service.py:create_multi_service_booking()`
- **Features**:
  - Supports parallel/sequential execution
  - Advanced availability checking
  - Complex time slot management
- **Issues**:
  - Duplicated pricing logic
  - Complex validation scattered across functions

#### Pattern 3: Walk-in Appointments (Individual Assignments)
- **Route**: `POST /appointments/walk-in`
- **File**: `Backend/Modules/Appointments/routes.py:262-318`
- **Service**: `kanban_service.py:create_walk_in_appointment_group_with_assignments()`
- **Features**:
  - Individual professional assignments per service
  - Immediate appointment creation
  - Client creation/lookup
- **Issues**:
  - Duplicated client handling logic
  - Pricing calculations repeated from other patterns

#### Pattern 4: Add Services to Existing Group
- **Route**: `POST /appointments/add-services/{group_id}`
- **File**: `Backend/Modules/Appointments/routes.py:321-377`
- **Service**: `kanban_service.py:add_services_to_appointment_group()`
- **Features**:
  - Extends existing appointment groups
  - Consecutive scheduling
- **Issues**:
  - Similar pricing/duration logic as creation patterns

### 2. Frontend Appointment Creation Patterns

#### Pattern A: Web-admin Kanban Walk-in
- **Location**: `Web-admin/Src/Pages/Appointments/KanbanPage.jsx`
- **Modal**: `AddServicesModal.jsx`
- **Flow**: 3-step process (Client â†’ Services â†’ Professional)
- **API**: `appointmentsApi.js:createWalkInAppointment()`
- **Features**:
  - Service variation selection
  - Individual professional assignment
  - Real-time price calculation

#### Pattern B: App-client Walk-in
- **Location**: `App-client/src/components/WalkInModal.jsx`
- **Flow**: 3-step modal (Client â†’ Services â†’ Professional)
- **API**: `appointmentService.js:createWalkInAppointment()`
- **Issues**:
  - Duplicates Web-admin logic
  - Separate API service implementation

#### Pattern C: App-client Scheduling Wizard
- **Location**: `App-client/src/components/SchedulingWizardModal.jsx`
- **Flow**: 6 wizard screens
- **API**: `wizardApiService.js:createMultiServiceBooking()`
- **Features**:
  - Advanced date/time selection
  - Professional availability checking
  - Multi-service coordination

#### Pattern D: Legacy Single Appointment (Web-admin)
- **API**: `appointmentsApi.js:createAppointment()`
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ **DEPRECATED** - Inconsistent usage

### 3. Code Duplication Analysis

#### Critical Duplications (Exact Code)

**1. Price/Duration Calculations** (4 instances)
```python
# Location 1: kanban_service.py:265-284
final_price = service.price + (variation.price_delta if variation else 0)
final_duration = (service.duration_minutes + service.processing_time + 
                 service.finishing_time + (variation.duration_delta if variation else 0))

# Location 2: wizard_service.py:153-166 (similar logic)
# Location 3: appointment_crud.py:81-82 (basic version)
# Location 4: Frontend AddServicesModal.jsx:373-378
```

**2. Client Creation/Lookup Logic** (3 instances)
```python
# Location 1: kanban_service.py:210-248
# Location 2: kanban_service.py:384-422 (in older function)
if client_data.get('id'):
    client = db.query(User).filter(User.id == client_data['id']).first()
else:
    if client_data.get('email'):
        client = db.query(User).filter(User.email == client_data['email']).first()
    if not client:
        client = User(...)  # Create new client
```

**3. Professional Assignment Patterns** (3 instances)
- Individual service assignments in walk-in flows
- Wizard professional selection logic
- Manual assignment in kanban interface

#### Moderate Duplications (Similar Logic)

**1. Service Validation** (5 instances)
- Different validation rules across creation methods
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Repeated service existence checks

**2. Time Management** (4 instances)
- Various approaches to time calculation
- Different availability checking algorithms
- Inconsistent time zone handling

**3. API Response Formatting** (6 instances)
- Different response structures across endpoints
- Inconsistent error response formats
- Duplicate data transformation logic

### 4. Architecture Issues

#### Service Layer Fragmentation
```
Current Structure:
Appointments/
â”œâ”€â”€ services.py (re-export facade)
â”œâ”€â”€ appointment_crud.py (legacy, single appointments)
â”œâ”€â”€ wizard_service.py (multi-service advanced)
â”œâ”€â”€ kanban_service.py (walk-in, quick creation)
â”œâ”€â”€ appointment_modifications.py (updates/cancellations)
â”œâ”€â”€ schedule_service.py (viewing/querying)
â””â”€â”€ availability_service.py (time slots)
```

**Problems:**
- Business logic scattered across 6 files
- No clear separation of concerns
- Duplicate implementations of core concepts
- Difficult to maintain consistency

#### Data Model Inconsistencies
- AppointmentGroup always created, even for single appointments
- Price calculations in multiple places with different logic
- Inconsistent professional assignment patterns
- No unified approach to status management

#### Frontend API Service Duplication
- `appointmentsApi.js` (Web-admin) vs `appointmentService.js` (App-client)
- `wizardApiService.js` duplicated across platforms
- Inconsistent error handling and data transformation

## Proposed Target Architecture

```

### 2. Unified Factory Pattern

```python
# Core Factory Interface
class AppointmentFactory:
    """Factory for creating different types of appointment groups"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_appointment_group(request: AppointmentGroupRequest) -> AppointmentGroup:
        """Unified creation method for all appointment types"""
        
        # Validate request
        validation_service.validate_appointment_request(request)
        
        # Handle client
        client = client_service.get_or_create_client(request.client_data)
        
        # Calculate pricing and duration
        pricing = pricing_service.calculate_group_pricing(request.services)
        
        # Create appointments with proper scheduling
        appointments = []
        for service_data in request.services:
            appointment = appointment_factory.create_appointment(
                client=client,
                service_data=service_data,
                group_context=request.group_context
            )
            appointments.append(appointment)
        
        # Create and return group
        return AppointmentGroup.create(
            client=client,
            appointments=appointments,
            pricing=pricing,
            metadata=request.metadata
        )
    
    @staticmethod
    def add_services_to_group(group_id: UUID, services: List[ServiceData]) -> AppointmentGroup:
        """Extend existing group with new services"""
        group = appointment_repository.get_group(group_id)
        
        # Reuse same creation logic for new services
        new_appointments = []
        for service_data in services:
            appointment = appointment_factory.create_appointment(
                client=group.client,
                service_data=service_data,
                group_context=group.context
            )
            new_appointments.append(appointment)
        
        group.add_appointments(new_appointments)
        return group
```

### 3. Unified Business Services

```python
# Pricing Service - Single Source of Truth
class PricingService:
    def calculate_service_price(
        self, 
        service: Service, 
        variation: ServiceVariation = None
    ) -> ServicePrice:
        """Calculate final price: Service Base + Variation Delta"""
        base_price = service.price
        variation_delta = variation.price_delta if variation else Decimal('0')
        return ServicePrice(
            base=base_price,
            variation_delta=variation_delta,
            final=base_price + variation_delta
        )
    
    def calculate_service_duration(
        self,
        service: Service,
        variation: ServiceVariation = None
    ) -> ServiceDuration:
        """Calculate total duration: Base + Processing + Finishing + Variation"""
        base_duration = service.duration_minutes or 0
        processing_time = service.processing_time or 0
        finishing_time = service.finishing_time or 0
        variation_delta = variation.duration_delta if variation else 0
        
        return ServiceDuration(
            base=base_duration,
            processing=processing_time,
            finishing=finishing_time,
            variation_delta=variation_delta,
            total=base_duration + processing_time + finishing_time + variation_delta
        )
    
    def calculate_group_totals(
        self, 
        services: List[ServiceWithVariation]
    ) -> GroupTotals:
        """Calculate totals for entire appointment group"""
        total_price = sum(
            self.calculate_service_price(s.service, s.variation).final 
            for s in services
        )
        total_duration = sum(
            self.calculate_service_duration(s.service, s.variation).total 
            for s in services
        )
        return GroupTotals(price=total_price, duration=total_duration)

# Client Service - Unified Client Management
class ClientService:
    def get_or_create_client(self, client_data: ClientData) -> User:
        """Unified client handling for all appointment creation flows"""
        
        # If ID provided, get existing
        if client_data.id:
            client = self.repository.get_by_id(client_data.id)
            if not client:
                raise ClientNotFoundError(f"Client {client_data.id} not found")
            return client
        
        # Search by email if provided
        if client_data.email:
            client = self.repository.get_by_email(client_data.email)
            if client:
                return client
        
        # Create new client
        return self.repository.create(
            User(
                full_name=client_data.name,
                email=client_data.email,
                phone_number=client_data.phone,
                role=UserRole.CLIENTE,
                # ... other fields
            )
        )
```

### 4. Frontend Unification Strategy

```javascript
// Unified API Service
class AppointmentApiService {
    async createAppointmentGroup(request) {
        return this.apiClient.post('/api/v1/appointments/groups', request);
    }
    
    async addServicesToGroup(groupId, services) {
        return this.apiClient.post(`/api/v1/appointments/groups/${groupId}/services`, {
            services
        });
    }
}

// Unified Creation Hook
const useAppointmentCreation = () => {
    const apiService = useAppointmentApiService();
    
    return {
        createWalkIn: (data) => apiService.createAppointmentGroup({
            type: 'walk-in',
            client: data.client,
            services: data.services,
            metadata: { immediate: true }
        }),
        
        createScheduled: (data) => apiService.createAppointmentGroup({
            type: 'scheduled',
            client: data.client,
            services: data.services,
            scheduling: data.timeSlots,
            metadata: { advance_booking: true }
        }),
        
        addServices: (groupId, services) => 
            apiService.addServicesToGroup(groupId, services)
    };
};

// Shared Calculation Utilities
export const appointmentCalculations = {
    calculateServicePrice: (service, variation) => {
        const basePrice = parseFloat(service.price) || 0;
        const variationDelta = parseFloat(variation?.price_delta) || 0;
        return basePrice + variationDelta;
    },
    
    calculateServiceDuration: (service, variation) => {
        const baseDuration = service.duration_minutes || 0;
        const processingTime = service.processing_time || 0;
        const finishingTime = service.finishing_time || 0;
        const variationDelta = variation?.duration_delta || 0;
        return baseDuration + processingTime + finishingTime + variationDelta;
    },
    
    calculateGroupTotals: (servicesWithVariations) => {
        const totalPrice = servicesWithVariations.reduce((sum, item) => {
            return sum + appointmentCalculations.calculateServicePrice(
                item.service, 
                item.variation
            ) * item.quantity;
        }, 0);
        
        const totalDuration = servicesWithVariations.reduce((sum, item) => {
            return sum + appointmentCalculations.calculateServiceDuration(
                item.service, 
                item.variation
            ) * item.quantity;
        }, 0);
        
        return { totalPrice, totalDuration };
    }
};
```
